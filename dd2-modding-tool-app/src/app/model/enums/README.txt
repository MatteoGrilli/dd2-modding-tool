The logic should be:
is it possible for the user to define more of these?
If the answer is yes, then no need to create an enumeration. This would be purpose of the suggestion system, but that is difficult
to make without a server, so maybe not for now.

If the answer is no, I will need to define the enumeration (and array) with all possible values.
